# RPA Challenge Collection (UiPath)

This repository contains a set of small UiPath workflows designed to demonstrate approaches to common automation tasks. Each workflow is self-contained and intended for experimentation, modification, and learning.

## Purpose

The project serves as a reference for:

* Exploring UiPath’s workflow design patterns
* Testing automation logic in isolated scenarios
* Practicing error handling, selectors, and data manipulation
* Building a foundation for larger automation solutions

## Requirements

* **UiPath Studio** (any recent version compatible with `project.json`)
* **UiPath dependencies** will be restored automatically when the project is opened.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rpa-challenge.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in **UiPath Studio**.
3. Review the `Main.xaml` file (or a file with the project name) in each project of the `sequences` folder to understand workflow routing.
4. Run individual sequences if you want to inspect logic in isolation.
5. Modify selectors, activities, or data tables as needed.

## Included Challenges

The repository can include tasks such as:

* Human Simulation: wake up, work, rest, sleep
* Simple Bank: start with a balance, and register some operations
* Vendor Machine: Buy some stuff with some chosen initial credits
* LibreOffice: Filling a form for each candidate in a dataset 
* And many more.

## Extending the Project

If you plan to grow the collection:

* Add each new challenge as its own sequence/challenge under `sequences/`
* Make the challenge as clear, clean and professional as possible (it's a challenge too)
* Keep selectors robust and include fallback strategies when needed

## Notes

* The repository is meant for experimentation rather than production deployment.
* The `.objects`, `.settings`, and storage folders are generated by UiPath and should remain under version control for reproducibility.
